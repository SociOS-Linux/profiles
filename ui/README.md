# @holochain-open-dev/profiles

UI Module for the Holochain zome `hc_zome_profiles`.

This package includes types, a service and a store, and a collection of Custom Elements to build Holochain applications that interact with the `hc_zome_profiles` zome. 

By using Custom Elements, this package exports reusable blocks of UI functionality that make it really easy for consuming web applications to include functionality to create and update profiles, or search for an agent in the DHT.

Read about how to include both the zome and this UI module in your application here:
